# Ball Ballancer

This is the repository for the Illini VEX Robotics 2021 Ball Balancing project. All code used in this project is open sourced as well 
as self-written. See references for the sources to the programs that are not our own original design. 

# starting_code
Each file in this folder is a file from another source. The files will be used to create longer and more comprehensive code in the output_code folder.

# output_code
Each file in this folder is an entry from a collaborator that stitches together code from the starting_code folder. The files can be for any use to the project.
