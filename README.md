# Folder Structure Help
"user_code" holds any code you'd like to commit to the github.
"reference_cde" holds any code taken from the internet.

For the project files, we will try use the standard folder structure for Github

TL;DR
"test" folder contains unit tests.
"src" folder is official code for the project. We might need a "dep" folder in the future.
